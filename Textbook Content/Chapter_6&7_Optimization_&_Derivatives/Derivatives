The Slope:
- The tangent line is created by drawing a line between two points that are “infinitely close” on a curve, but this
curve has to be continuous and smooth. 
- Because this is a curve, there is no single slope. In fact, slope depends on where we measure it, so there are
infinite number of courses.

The Numerical Derivative: (Check The Numerical Derivative.ipynb for demostration). 
- The method of calculating the slope of the tangent line using two infinitely close points is called numerical
differentiation.
- The smaller the delta (the distance between two points), the smoother the line becomes.
- As you have known, the function for a straight line is y = mx + b, where "m" is the slope, "x" is the input and 
b is the y-intercept, which also equals to: y - mx.

The Analytical Derivative:
- Numerical solution methods involve coming up with a number to find a solution, which is an approximation. 
On the other hand, the analytical method offers the exact and much quicker, in terms of calculation, solution.
- If you want to know how to do partial derivatives, see Calculus: Early Transcendentals, Chapter 14: Partial Derivatives for more detail.
